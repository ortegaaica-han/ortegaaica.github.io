            <h2 class="section-title">Childhood Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sup>1</sup>I was born in <b>Pasig City, Philippines</b>, on June 25, 2005.
                <sup>2</sup>My childhood was spent moving between several Philippine cities, including Laguna, Rizal, and Antipolo.
                <sup>3</sup>Even as a young child, I began travelling the world extensively, thanks to my supportive uncle.
                <sup>4</sup>My uncle, who had no family of his own, had a great passion for exploring new destinations.
                <sup>5</sup>He <i>generously</i> chose to bring me along on his frequent international trips.
                <sup>6</sup>This early exposure to travel shaped my perspective from a very young age.
                <sup>7</sup>For a memorable period, I even got to live with him in Pennsylvania, US, for a few months.
                <sup>8</sup>Eventually, I returned to the Philippines to ensure I could continue my education properly.
                <sup>9</sup>Prior to permanently settling down, I was enrolled in a small, local private school.
                <sup>10</sup>During this time, my attendance was inconsistent because of my constant international travel.
                <sup>11</sup>When I was present in the classroom, I unfortunately faced <strong>bullying</strong> from some male classmates.
                <sup>12</sup>This repeated negative experience sadly caused me to develop a growing fear of boys and men.
                <sup>13</sup>To address this fear and ensure a safe environment, I approached my mother with a request.
                <sup>14</sup>I asked her to enroll me in an <u>all-girls</u> educational institution.
                <sup>15</sup>My mother understood my needs and kindly agreed to my suggestion.
                <sup>16</sup>She enrolled me in the supportive environment of St. Scholastica’s Academy of Marikina (SSAM).
                <sup>17</sup>Since I started living and studying permanently in the Philippines at the age of twelve, everything changed.
                <sup>18</sup>I began forming deep, lasting friendships that have enriched my life significantly.
                <sup>19</sup>I also started creating <mark>countless beautiful memories</mark> within my new school community.
                <sup>20</sup>These experiences are moments I constantly wish I could return to and cherish once more.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Teenage Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sup>1</sup>My teenage years were certainly not pleasant, and they hold many challenging memories.
                <sup>2</sup>Before I reached senior high school at St. Scholastica's Academy of Marikina (SSAM), I faced numerous difficulties.
                <sup>3</sup>These challenges primarily revolved around family issues and my own mental health struggles.
                <sup>4</sup>SSAM is highly regarded as one of the best schools in Marikina City.
                <sup>5</sup>Students are generally expected to demonstrate academic excellence.
                <sup>6</sup>Honestly, I did not consider myself to be one of those academically excellent students.
                <sup>7</sup>My initial years at the school had been pleasant, and I found it relatively easy to adjust to the environment.
                <sup>8</sup>However, an incident where I was accused of cheating during a test marked the day my life began to genuinely fall apart.
                <sup>9</sup>I maintain that I did not cheat, but from my teacher’s perspective, I appeared to be the culprit in the classroom.
                <sup>10</sup>In reality, it was my seatmate who was actually cheating and was bothering me, yet I was forced to become the one held <strong>accountable</strong>.
                <sup>11</sup>This false accusation made my stomach lurch in disgust, as I fundamentally believe in strong morals.
                <sup>12</sup>I initially tried to come up with various excuses so my parents wouldn’t hear about the incident.
                <sup>13</sup>In the end, I had to tell them the truth, and they slowly began to lose their trust in me.
                <sup>14</sup>Following this deeply upsetting event, my academic grades started to drop significantly.
                <sup>15</sup>The same teacher who falsely accused me then began to pursue an inappropriate relationship.
                <sup>16</sup>I was merely a minor who was essentially honey-trapped into situations I was too young to understand.
                <sup>17</sup>This abuse tragically continued for years until it finally stopped when I reached 8th grade.
                <sup>18</sup>That was the pivotal time I realized I had been molested, which prevented me from fully enjoying high school.
                <sup>19</sup>The COVID-19 pandemic soon arrived, meaning I was unable to experience the conclusion of traditional school.
                <sup>20</sup>I also relocated to Toronto, Canada, during the pandemic and met the love of my life.

            <h2 class="section-title">College Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sup>1</sup>Having been immersed in an all-girls school for most of my life, my social interactions with men had been limited.
                <sup>2</sup>My only recent connection with guys had been through occasional online communication.
                <sup>3</sup>Upon entering college, I took a course that I quickly realized was overwhelmingly male-dominated.
                <sup>4</sup>At first, the environment felt incredibly rowdy, chaotic, and deeply uncomfortable.
                <sup>5</sup>During the entire first month, I practically tried to remain <i>invincible</i> to everyone around me.
                <sup>6</sup>I felt completely unsure about how to initiate a conversation or even engage with them.
                <sup>7</sup>I silently observed and judged everybody’s actions and behaviors during that initial phase.
                <sup>8</sup>I soon realized that while we all came from vastly different worlds, there was a shared commonality.
                <sup>9</sup>It took me a month and a half to actually begin making friends.
                <sup>10</sup>The deliberate pace was worth it because I got to intentionally choose my companions.
                <sup>11</sup>These friends will now accompany me throughout my entire college journey.
                <sup>12</sup>In terms of academics, entering this new course quickly became a humbling experience.
                <sup>13</sup>The workload truly tests your time management skills and ability to complete demanding tasks.
                <sup>14</sup>I must admit that these crucial skills are currently areas where I am still struggling to improve.
                <sup>15</sup>Beyond the classroom, learning about different sides of the world has been fun.
                <sup>16</sup>I’ve happily learned new words and phrases, such as “late night food trips.”
                <sup>17</sup>Other terms I first encountered include “spontaneous dates with friends.”
                <sup>18</sup>I also learned the Filipino term “gastador” (a big spender).
                <sup>19</sup>Encountering these social habits has been an enriching part of my adaptation.
                <sup>20</sup>Every new word and social encounter helps me feel more connected to this diverse environment.
